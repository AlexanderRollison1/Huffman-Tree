# Huffman-Tree
using Huffman Tree / Encoding and Decoding strings based on frequency/sort
.txt files purpose: These are examples that show how the input/output will look like. If we have an input .txt file that in tree format, I will decode this information and print out the decoded string to the screen. Though I could have printed to file, people did not do this for the assignment as it was not required.
